// -------- Operators --------
/*

1. Arithmatic operators : It contains nearly all arithmatic operations that we can perform with the help of a calculator.

Symbols for such operators : 
console.log(5 + 7) --> add
console.log(5 - 7) --> substract
console.log(5 * 7) --> multiply
console.log(5 ** 7) --> gives the 7 power of 5
console.log(5 / 7) --> float division
console.log(5 % 7) --> gives remainder
console.log(a ++) --> increment  //also ++a (means first increase)
console.log(a --) --> decrement  //also --a (means first decrease)

2. Assignment operators : The assignment operator is used to assign values to a variable. In some cases, we have to assign a variableâ€™s value to another variable, in such cases the value of the right operand is assigned to the left operand. Such operators are : 
a = 25
a += 3 --> a = a + 1
a -= 3 --> a = a - 1
a *= 3 --> a = a * 1
a **= 2 --> a = a ** 1
a /= 3 --> a = a / 1
a %= 6 --> a = a % 1
console.log(a)

3. Comparison Operators : They are also known as relational operators. They compare the values on either side of the operator and decide the relation among them. Commonly used comparison operators : 

var b = 3
var c = 8

console.log(b == c) --> equal to
console.log(b === c) --> equal value and equal type
console.log(b != c) --> not equal
console.log(b !== c) --> not equal value or not equal type
console.log(b <= c) --> less than or equal to
console.log(b >= c) --> greater than or equal to
console.log(b < c) --> less than
console.log(b > c) --> greater than

4. Logical Operators : Logical operators perform logical &&, || and !, operations. They are usually used in conditional statements to join multiple conditions. AND, OR and NOT keywords are used to perform logical operations. Example :

console.log(57 && 8)
console.log(57 || 8)
console.log( !true )

5. Bitwise Operators : Bitwise operands are used to perform bit by bit operation on binary numbers. First, we have to change the format of the number from decimal to binary and then compare them using AND, OR, XOR, NOT, etc.
console.log(0 & 2) --> AND
console.log(0 | 3) --> OR
console.log(0 ~ 3) --> NOT
console.log(0 ^ 3) --> XOR
console.log(0 << 3) --> left shift
console.log(0 >> 3) --> right shift
console.log(0 >>> 3)  --> unsigned right shift

6. Special Operators : Special operators for special conditions

a = (1>2) ? true : false --> Short hand if-else (ternary operator)
console.log(2 in [1,2,3,4,5]) --> check if element is a member of the given object
console.log(typeof 23) --> check the type of the given object
